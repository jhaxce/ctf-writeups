## About the Challenge
We are given a text file with hex values (You can download the text file [here](magic_key.zip)). This is the preview of the text.

## How to Solve?
I identified it as a hex file and convert it to ASCII using a hex editor.

The ASCII text is a base64 encoded string. Decoding the base64 string and render it as images gives us the flag.
